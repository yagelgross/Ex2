# Ex2: Spreadsheet


This project was an assignment given to me as part of the:
**Intro to Computer Science (Intro2CS) 2025** coursework.

## Summary

This spreadsheet project serves as a practical exercise in building a structured,
scalable, and user-friendly application using object-oriented programming concepts.
It has allowed me to further develop my programming and problem-solving skills while
solidifying key computer science principles.
## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a functional spreadsheet system,
similar to those used in popular software, where users can input, compute, and store data
in a structured format using the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).

Through this project, I aim to:
- Gain deeper insights into OOP, including but not limited to:
    - Interfaces
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - Exception handling
    - Design patterns
    - And more
- Improve my programming skills with Java by applying theoretical concepts in a real-world application.
- Learn the practical application of computer science principles, such as algorithms, data structures, and error handling.

## Key Learning Outcomes

This project provided an opportunity to explore and apply the following topics:

1. Object-Oriented Programming:
    - Understanding and implementing interfaces.
    - Applying encapsulation to maintain data integrity.
    - Leveraging inheritance for reusable components.
    - Properly handling exceptions to ensure reliable operation.
2. Java Programming:
    - Writing efficient, clean, and modular code.
    - Working with Java libraries for input handling and computation.
    - Debugging and testing Java programs effectively.
3. Problem Solving:
    - Designing solutions for complex requirements like formula evaluation.
    - Managing edge cases and ensuring optimal performance.
4. Software Development Practices:
    - Collaborating with an integrated development environment (IDE) like IntelliJ.
    - Using version control tools (e.g., Git) to track and manage changes effectively.


## Features

The spreadsheet project includes the following features:

- **Cell Management:** Users can input and update data in individual cells.
- **Formula Evaluation:** Evaluate expressions entered in spreadsheet cells using standard mathematical and logical operations.
- **Error Detection:** Handle errors gracefully, such as circular dependencies or invalid input.
- **Data Storage:** Ability to maintain data consistency across multiple operations.

~~~~## Technologies Used~~~~

- Programming Language: Java
- Development Environment: IntelliJ IDEA
- Version Control: Git (for managing changes during development)
